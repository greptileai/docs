    Build custom internal AI dev tools such as PR review bots, Slackbots, documentation updaters and more, with the power of full codebase context. See [examples](/examples)
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Motivation

We believe that full codebase-context is the core problem in building AI developer tools. With reliable, full codebase context, developers can build unlimited tooling, from PR review bots, to JIRA ticket annotators, to Slackbots to answer questions about the source code, and much, much more.

Our mission at Greptile is to provide developers with that infrastructure as an easy-to-use API.

## What will you build?

Here are some examples of internal tools you can build for your team with Greptile's API:

  </Step>

  <Step
    title="Failed Test Diagnosis Bot"
    icon="user-magnifying-glass"
  >
  Pass in outupt of failed tests in GitHub Actions into Greptile's API and get a diagnosis on why the test failed.
  </Step>

  <Step
    title="Automatic Docs Updater"
    icon="book-sparkles"
  >
    Build a bot that writes a PR to update your docs every time you push new code, so your docs are always up-to-date.
  </Step>

    <Step
    title="Ticket Enricher"
    icon="list-check"

    Automatically add context and instructions to new tickets made in your task manager - Linear, Jira, etc.
