## Sequence Diagram Generation

Greptile can **automatically generate sequence diagrams** to visualize complex code interactions and workflows.

### When Diagrams Are Generated
- **Complex API flows** - Multi-service interactions and data flows
- **Authentication workflows** - Login, token validation, and user sessions
- **Business process implementations** - Order processing, payment flows, etc.
- **Error handling chains** - How errors propagate through the system

### Requesting Specific Diagrams
You can request diagrams in your PR description or comments:

```markdown
@greptileai can you generate a sequence diagram for the new payment processing flow?
```

### Example Generated Diagrams
Greptile creates diagrams showing:
- **Service interactions** - API calls between microservices
- **Database operations** - Query sequences and transactions
- **External integrations** - Third-party API interactions
- **User journeys** - Frontend to backend workflows

### Integration with Reviews
- **Diagrams appear in PR summaries** when complex flows are detected
- **Architecture validation** - Diagrams help reviewers understand system interactions
- **Documentation generation** - Diagrams can be saved for future reference

## Architectural Analysis

Greptile provides deep insights into software architecture and design patterns.

### Architecture Problem Detection

#### Design Pattern Violations
- **Singleton misuse** - Identifying inappropriate singleton implementations
- **God objects** - Classes or modules with too many responsibilities
- **Circular dependencies** - Import cycles and dependency issues
- **Tight coupling** - Components that are overly dependent on each other

#### Architectural Concerns
- **Layer violations** - Business logic in presentation layers
- **Abstraction leakage** - Implementation details exposed in interfaces
- **Separation of concerns** - Mixed responsibilities within components
- **SOLID principle violations** - Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.

### Performance Architecture Analysis

#### Scalability Issues
- **Database bottlenecks** - N+1 queries, missing indexes
- **Memory inefficiencies** - Unnecessary object creation, memory leaks
- **CPU optimization opportunities** - Algorithm improvements, caching strategies
- **Network optimization** - API call reduction, bundling opportunities

#### System Design Improvements
- **Caching strategies** - Where to implement caching for better performance
- **Async processing** - Opportunities for background job processing
- **Resource pooling** - Database connections, HTTP clients
- **Load distribution** - Identifying single points of failure

### Cross-System Impact Analysis

#### Dependency Analysis
- **Breaking change detection** - API changes that affect downstream services
- **Contract validation** - Interface changes and compatibility
- **Version compatibility** - Library and framework version conflicts
- **Migration impact** - Database schema changes and their effects

#### Integration Points
- **Third-party service dependencies** - External API reliability concerns
- **Configuration management** - Environment-specific settings validation
- **Security boundaries** - Trust zones and data flow security

## Optimization Insights

### Code Optimization Opportunities

#### Algorithm Improvements
```javascript
// Greptile might suggest:
// "This O(nÂ²) nested loop could be optimized to O(n log n)
// using a hash map approach"

const findDuplicates = (arr) => {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        duplicates.push(arr[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
};
```

#### Resource Optimization
- **Memory usage patterns** - Identifying memory-intensive operations
- **I/O optimization** - File system and database access improvements
- **Concurrent processing** - Opportunities for parallel execution
- **Lazy loading** - Deferred initialization of expensive resources

### Business Logic Optimization

#### Process Efficiency
- **Workflow simplification** - Reducing unnecessary steps
- **Business rule conflicts** - Identifying contradictory logic
- **Data validation redundancy** - Eliminating duplicate checks
- **Error handling efficiency** - Streamlined error recovery

#### User Experience Optimization
- **Response time improvements** - Faster API endpoints
- **UI performance** - Rendering optimization suggestions
- **Accessibility enhancements** - Screen reader compatibility
- **Mobile optimization** - Touch-friendly interface improvements

## Architectural Documentation Generation

### System Overview Creation
Greptile can generate documentation describing:
- **Component relationships** - How services interact
- **Data flow diagrams** - Information movement through the system
- **API documentation** - Endpoint descriptions and usage patterns
- **Architecture decision records** - Rationale behind design choices

### Pattern Recognition and Documentation
- **Established patterns** - Identifying and documenting recurring patterns
- **Anti-patterns** - Warning about problematic implementations
- **Best practices** - Suggesting improvements based on industry standards
- **Team conventions** - Learning and enforcing team-specific patterns

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pull Request Enhancement
- **Architecture summaries** - High-level impact descriptions
- **Performance predictions** - Expected impact on system performance
- **Security implications** - Potential security considerations
- **Maintenance burden** - Long-term maintainability assessment

### Continuous Architecture Monitoring
- **Trend analysis** - Architecture quality over time
- **Technical debt identification** - Areas needing refactoring
- **Complexity metrics** - Measuring code and system complexity
- **Evolution tracking** - How the architecture changes with each release

## Advanced Configuration

### Enabling Advanced Features
```json greptile.json
{
  "advancedAnalysis": {
    "generateDiagrams": true,
    "architecturalAnalysis": true,
    "performanceInsights": true,
    "optimizationSuggestions": true
  },
  "instructions": "Focus on architectural improvements and include sequence diagrams for complex workflows"
}
```

### Feature-Specific Settings
```json
{
  "diagramGeneration": {
    "threshold": "complex",    // Generate diagrams for complex flows only
    "includeDatabase": true,   // Show database interactions
    "includeExternal": true    // Show external API calls
  },
  "architecturalAnalysis": {
    "designPatterns": true,    // Check design pattern compliance
    "layerViolations": true,   // Detect architectural layer violations
    "performanceImpact": true  // Analyze performance implications
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Maximizing Advanced Feature Value
1. **Clear PR descriptions** - Help Greptile understand the intended architecture
2. **Consistent patterns** - Establish and document your architectural standards
3. **Regular review** - Use insights to guide architectural decisions
4. **Team education** - Share architectural insights with the team

### Performance Considerations
- **Large systems** - Advanced analysis may take longer for complex codebases
- **Configuration tuning** - Adjust thresholds based on your needs
- **Selective enablement** - Enable features only where they add value

### Integration Tips
- **Documentation workflow** - Save generated diagrams to project documentation
- **Architecture reviews** - Use insights during formal architecture review sessions
- **Refactoring planning** - Prioritize improvements based on Greptile's suggestions
