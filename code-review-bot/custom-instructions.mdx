You can customize Greptile's behavior by providing "custom instructions" for the bot to follow, for example, "Include a section on compliance implications of the changes in the PR."

You can edit custom instructions on the [dashboard](https://app.greptile.com/), or via [`greptile.json`](code-review-bot/greptile-json) file in your repo.

## What can you put into custom instructions?

Custom instructions are a modified version of a system prompt. 

### 1. Reference my style guide
    If you have a style guide file in the repo, you can add the something like this to your custom instructions:
    ```
    Reference path/to/styleguide.md and enforce those rules.
    ```

### 2. Enforce my custom patterns
    Customize Greptile's behavior by providing "custom instructions" for the bot to follow, for example:
    ```
    Enforce the following patterns:
    - For GraphQL:
      - Ensure schema is well-documented with clear descriptions
      - Use consistent and meaningful naming conventions
      - Keep schema organization logical and maintainable
    - For Go:
      - Follow idiomatic Go patterns and conventions
      - Use clear and descriptive names that indicate purpose
      - Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
      - Handle errors consistently and explicitly
    ```

### 3. Helpful context on business logic
    You can add specific business logic rules directly in the custom instructions, for example:
    ```
    Ensure billing logic follows these rules:
    - User accounts should be deactivated after 90 days of inactivity
    - Orders over $1000 require manager approval
    - Refunds must be processed within 48 hours
    - Premium users should have priority queue access
    ```
