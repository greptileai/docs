By default, Greptile reviews **every new PR** when it is first opened or when a user comments `@greptileai` on the PR. It can also be configured to review PRs on certain triggers.


### Filters

You can configure Greptile to only review PRs that match certain filters. The filters can be configured in the [dashboard](https://app.greptile.com/review), or in your [`greptile.json` file](/code-review-bot/greptile-json).

| Filter By | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `labels`  | Include or exclude PRs with specific labels |
| `branches` | Include or exclude PRs to or from specific branches |
| `author` | Include or exclude PRs based on PR author |
| `keywords` | Include or exclude PRs containing a specific keyword in the title, description,or last commit message |


### Trigger Manually

You can trigger Greptile to review a PR manually by commenting `@greptileai` on the PR.

<Note>
GitHub does not allow users to tag bots, so as you comment `@greptileai` it may not show you the bot in the dropdown suggestions..
</Note>

### Trigger via Github Action

If you only want Greptile to review your PRs after certain actions were successful, e.g. because a Greptile review does not make sense if linter actions are failing anyway and test were not passing, then you can use the comment approach from above. Here's a sample github action pipeline:

```
name: Continuous Testing

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # do your thing here
  Greptile:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          message: "@greptileai Can you please review this PR?"
    needs: test 
```
