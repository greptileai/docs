The admin dashboard provides different permission levels to control what users can access and manage within your organization.

## Permission levels

### Members

Members have access to core functionality needed for day-to-day development work:

- **Manage repositories** - Add, remove, and configure repositories for code review
- **Configure integrations** - Set up and manage GitHub, GitLab, and other service integrations  
- **View analytics** - Access code review metrics, usage statistics, and performance data

### Admins

Admins have all member permissions plus additional administrative capabilities:

- **Manage user roles** - Assign and modify user permission levels within the organization
- **Manage billing** - Access billing information, update payment methods, and manage subscriptions

### Owners

Owners have the highest level of access with all admin permissions plus:

- **Delete organization** - Permanently remove the organization and all associated data

<Warning>
Organization deletion is irreversible and will permanently remove all repositories, settings, analytics data, and user access.
</Warning>

## Managing user permissions

To modify user permissions in your organization:

1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. Go to the user management section
3. Select the user whose permissions you want to change
