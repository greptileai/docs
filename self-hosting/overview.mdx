title: Self-Hosting Overview
description: 'Complete guide to deploying Greptile infrastructure on-premises'
---

This section provides comprehensive guides for self-hosting Greptile using the [akupara repository](https://github.com/greptileai/akupara). We offer two primary methods of deployment: `docker-compose` and `kubernetes`. We strongly recommend using the `docker-compose` method as it is simpler and more flexible.

<Info>
The akupara repository contains all the infrastructure code and deployment guides for running Greptile on-premises. Make sure to download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/greptileai/akupara/releases).

## Architecture Overview

### Docker Compose Architecture
The docker-compose deployment provides a streamlined architecture suitable for most on-premises deployments:
