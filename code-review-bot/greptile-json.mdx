metaTitle: "Greptile Docs: Repository-Level Configuration with greptile.json"
metaDescription: "Learn how to customize Greptile settings and patterns for individual repositories
using greptile.json configuration."
---

You can have custom settings at the repo level by adding a `greptile.json` file to the root of the
repo. Settings will be read from the source branch of the PR.

You can grab your global settings in the correct format
[here](https://app.greptile.com/review/github?tab=config) by clicking on the `copy` or `download` icons
  on the top right of the Settings panel.

### Configuration Hierarchy

Settings in `greptile.json` **override** dashboard settings for that repository. The hierarchy is:
1. **greptile.json** (highest priority) - Repository-specific configuration
2. **Dashboard settings** (lower priority) - Organization-wide defaults

This allows you to set organization-wide defaults in the dashboard while customizing specific repositories with greptile.json.

<Note>
  The `ignorePatterns` field follows `.gitignore`
  [syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

## Comment Types Explained

### Available Comment Types
- **`logic`** - Business logic issues, algorithmic problems, potential bugs
- **`syntax`** - Language-specific best practices, proper usage patterns
- **`style`** - Code formatting, naming conventions, structural consistency

All comment types are **enabled by default**. You can restrict reviews to specific types by setting `commentTypes` to a subset.

### Example Configurations
```json
// Only check for logic issues (most critical)
{
  "commentTypes": ["logic"]
}

// Focus on code quality without style nitpicks
{
  "commentTypes": ["logic", "syntax"]
}
```

## Directory-Specific Rules

You can apply different rules to specific directories using glob patterns:

```json
{
  "directoryRules": {
    "src/critical/**": {
      "strictness": 1,
      "commentTypes": ["logic", "syntax"]
    },
    "tests/**": {
      "strictness": 3,
      "commentTypes": ["logic"]
    },
    "docs/**": {
      "strictness": 2,
      "commentTypes": ["style"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Cases
- **Critical paths** - Maximum scrutiny on core business logic
- **Test files** - Focus only on serious issues
- **Documentation** - Primarily style and formatting checks
- **Legacy code** - Reduced noise during refactoring


## Custom Context Explained

The `customContext` field allows you to provide additional context to help Greptile make more informed
code review decisions. It supports three types of context, each with optional scope targeting:

### Custom Context Types

**`rules`** - Specific coding rules to enforce
- Define custom coding standards, best practices, or project-specific requirements
- More specific than general instructions, focused on enforceable coding practices

**`files`** - Reference existing documentation files
- Point Greptile to existing documentation, style guides, or reference files in your repository
- Includes a `path` field to specify the file location and optional `description` for context

**`other`** - General instructions or context
- Provide additional background information about your codebase, team practices, or specific
requirements
- Use for high-level guidance that doesn't fit into rules or file references


### Scope Targeting

Each context item supports an optional `scope` array that uses glob patterns to target specific files:

```json
"scope": ["*.ts", "*.js"]        // Apply to TypeScript and JavaScript files
"scope": ["src/**/*.py"]         // Apply to Python files in src directory
"scope": ["tests/**/*"]          // Apply to all files in tests directory
"scope": ["*.md", "docs/**/*"]   // Apply to markdown files and docs folder
```
If no scope is specified, the context applies to all files in the review.
