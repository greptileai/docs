<Note>
    We now have a first party integration with Linear! Check it out [here](https://app.greptile.com/apps/linear). 
    These steps still apply to other Zapier integrations.

## Greptile + Linear
    <img src="/images/task-enricher/hero.png" />
As a software engineer I would often feel lost when I first looked at a ticket assigned to me.
Today, we will integrate Greptile with your task manager (in this example, [Linear](https://linear.app)) so every time a new ticket is created, Greptile will add a comment with context from the codebase, including specific file paths relevant to the task.

Here's what that will look like:

### Add Blocks

Add event blocks exactly as shown in this image:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/task-enricher/map.png"/>
</Frame>

1. **New Issue in Linear:** This block is triggered when a new issue is created in Linear. You will need to follow instructions in this block to connect your Linear account.
2. **Webhooks, Custom Request:** This is where the request to the Greptile API is made. More detail on this below.
3. **Formatter:** This is to separate the filepaths returned by the Greptile API with newlines.
4. **Create Comment in Linear**: This adds the Greptile comment to the original Linear task that triggered this run.

### Calling the Greptile API


#### Set `Event` to `Custom Request`

#### Configure Request Options
URL -> `https://app.greptile.com/v2/query`
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/task-enricher/method.png"/>
</Frame>

#### Paste this object into `body` and insert the Linear `title` and `description`

This is what you should paste in:
```json
{
   "messages":[
      {
         "id": "00000", // optional
         "content":"Generate 3 extremely concise bullet point instructions for the following task.",
         "role":"system"
      },
      {
         "id": "00001", // optional
         // Use "Insert Data ..." here
         "content":"[INSERT_LINEAR_TASK_TITLE]: [INSERT_LINEAR_TASK_DESC]",
         "role":"user"
      }
   ],
   "repositories":[
      {
         "repository":"YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_1",
         "branch":"main"
      },
      {
         "repository":"YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_2",
         "branch":"main"
      },
      ...
   ]
}
```
Once you insert the data from the Linear event block, it should look like this:
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/task-enricher/body.png"/>
</Frame>

#### Authenticate
Configure the headers like this:
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/task-enricher/auth.png"/>
</Frame>

1. Get your Greptile API key [here](https://app.greptile.com/api/)
2. Get your GitHub Access Token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

Remember to add `"Bearer"` to the `Authorization` header value.

#### Format and Add Linear Comment

Easy last step, configure the final two blocks.

1. **Format**: This is optional, but I wanted my source filepaths to show up as newline seperated, so I used `Formatter` to do that.
2. **Add Comment**: In this Linear block, simply configure it with the `Issue Id` of the original task, and add the `message` from the Greptile API as the body.

This is what that should look like:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/task-enricher/comment.png"/>
</Frame>

That's it! Test the Zap and within 20-25 seconds of creating a new ticket in Linear, you should see a comment from Greptile adding helpful context!
