This guide covers proven strategies for getting the most value from Greptile based on real-world team experiences. For a quick overview of capabilities, see the [developer quick reference](/developer-quick-reference).

## Configuration Options You Should Know

Get started with the [getting started guide](/code-review-bot/getting-started) if you haven't set up Greptile yet.

### Dashboard Configuration

Learn more about all available settings in the [key features](/code-review-bot/key-features) guide.

#### Adjust how many comments Greptile makes

The severity threshold is your primary tool for controlling how many comments Greptile makes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Low Threshold">
    **More comments, more detail**
    - Comments on potential issues
    - Includes minor suggestions
    - Good for teams that value detailed feedback
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium Threshold">
    **Balanced approach (default)**
    - Mix of minor and major issues
    - Filters out most nitpicks
    - Recommended starting point
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Threshold">
    **Critical issues only**
    - Fewer, high-impact comments
    - Focuses on bugs and security
    - Good for teams that find the bot too noisy
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Start with medium threshold and adjust based on your team's feedback. If you're getting too much noise, increase it. If you want more detail, decrease it.
</Tip>

#### Adjust what types of comments Greptile makes

You can control which types of issues Greptile comments on:

- **Syntax**: Basic code structure and formatting
- **Logic**: Potential bugs and logical issues
- **Style**: Coding conventions and best practices

<Note>
Many teams disable syntax comments if they already use a linter, letting Greptile focus on logic and style issues that automated tools miss.
</Note>

## Help Greptile Learn About Your Codebase and Patterns

Learn more about how Greptile learns in the [memory and learning](/how-greptile-works/memory-and-learning) guide.

### Effective Comment Interaction

<Steps>
  <Step title="React to Comments">
    Use üëç for helpful comments and üëé for unhelpful ones. This is the primary way Greptile learns your preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explain Your Feedback">
    When downvoting, reply explaining why: `@greptileai Actually, we prefer list comprehensions because they're more readable`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Questions">
    Tag `@greptileai` to ask for clarification: `@greptileai Can you explain why this is a security issue?`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Be Consistent">
    Regular, consistent feedback across team members helps Greptile learn faster.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Learning timeline

<Info>
**2-3 weeks** of consistent feedback typically shows noticeable improvement in comment relevance and accuracy.
</Info>

Early weeks may have more noise as Greptile learns your team's preferences. The system gets better at:
- Filtering suggestions to what your team values
- Understanding your codebase context
- Recognizing your team's coding patterns

### What does Greptile learn from?

- Your reactions to its comments
- Other developers' comments on PRs
- Which suggestions get implemented vs ignored
- Team discussions about code patterns

## Managing Custom Context

### Types of Custom Context

See the full [custom context guide](/code-review-bot/custom-context) for detailed instructions.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Rules" icon="gavel">
    **Team Preferences**
    - Enforce coding standards
    - Specify preferred patterns
    - Set architectural guidelines
  </Card>
  <Card title="Files" icon="book">
    **Documentation**
    - Style guides
    - Architecture docs
    - API standards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Other" icon="info">
    **Additional Info**
    - Project context
    - Domain knowledge
    - Special requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Effective Context Rules

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Examples">
    ```
    "Use async/await instead of Promise chains for better readability"

    "All API endpoints must validate input parameters"

    "Prefer functional components over class components in React"

    "Database queries should use prepared statements"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scoping Rules">
    Apply rules to specific contexts:
    - Specific repositories
    - File types (e.g., only `.py` files)
    - Directory paths (e.g., `src/backend/**`)
    - Multiple scopes per rule
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Context File Best Practices

Point Greptile to your existing documentation:
- **Style guides**: Language-specific coding standards
- **Architecture docs**: System design and patterns
- **Security policies**: Compliance and security requirements
- **API standards**: Consistent API design patterns
- **Testing strategies**: How your team approaches testing

<Warning>
Review learned rules regularly. Greptile automatically creates rules based on team comments, but you should verify they align with your actual preferences.
</Warning>

## Advanced Configuration

### Repository-Level Settings

Use `greptile.json` in your repository root for per-repo configuration. Learn more in the [greptile.json guide](/code-review-bot/greptile-json):

```json
{
  "strictness": 2,
  "commentTypes": ["logic", "style"],
  "patternsRepo": ["org/frontend-repo"],
  "customInstructions": "Focus on security and performance",
  "scope": {
    "include": ["src/**"],
    "exclude": ["tests/**", "docs/**"]
  }
}
```

### Analytics Monitoring

Track these key metrics in your dashboard:
- **Average time to merge**: Are reviews helping or slowing down merges?
- **Comment engagement**: High upvote rates indicate valuable feedback
- **Addressed comments per MR**: Shows team adoption and value

### Integration Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trigger Configuration">
    Set up smart triggers based on:
    - Specific authors (new team members)
    - Branch patterns (feature branches)
    - PR labels (needs-review)
    - File types (critical system files)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pattern Repositories">
    Link related repositories for better context:
    - Add frontend repo to backend reviews
    - Include shared library repositories
    - Cross-reference microservice dependencies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Team Adoption Strategies

### For New Teams

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Conservative">
    Begin with high severity threshold to build confidence with fewer, high-quality comments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encourage Engagement">
    Train team members on upvoting/downvoting and asking questions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate Based on Feedback">
    Adjust settings weekly based on team feedback and analytics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Context Gradually">
    Start with key style guides, then add more context as the team sees value.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Warning>
**Don't ignore the learning period.** Greptile needs 2-3 weeks of consistent feedback to understand your team's preferences.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Don't set severity too low initially.** Start conservative and lower the threshold once the team is comfortable with the feedback quality.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Don't forget to scope custom rules.** Broad rules applied everywhere can create noise in inappropriate contexts.
</Warning>

<Info>
Remember: Greptile learns continuously. Regular engagement and feedback make it more valuable over time.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Greptile isn't reviewing my PR">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Your PR doesn't match configured trigger rules (labels, authors, branches)
    - Changes are in excluded files or directories
    - Repository indexing is still in progress (check for "updating" tag in dashboard)

    **Solutions:**
    - Try manual trigger: comment `@greptileai` on the PR (see [manual triggers](/code-review-bot/trigger-code-review))
    - Check your team's trigger configuration in dashboard settings
    - Verify the repository is properly connected and indexed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting too many irrelevant comments">
    **Solutions:**
    - Increase severity threshold in dashboard settings (move from Low ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí High)
    - Disable comment types you don't need (syntax if you use a linter)
    - Downvote irrelevant comments consistently to help Greptile learn
    - Add custom rules to clarify your team's preferences (see [custom context](/code-review-bot/custom-context))
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comments aren't helpful or accurate">
    **This is normal in the first 2-3 weeks.** Greptile needs feedback to learn your preferences.

    **Solutions:**
    - Consistently upvote helpful comments, downvote unhelpful ones
    - Reply to explain why comments are wrong: `@greptileai Actually, this pattern is preferred in our codebase because...`
    - Add custom context about your team's standards and architectural decisions (see [custom context](/code-review-bot/custom-context))
    - Be patient - learning takes time but improves significantly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Repository indexing is taking too long">
    **This is normal for large codebases.** Initial indexing is compute-intensive and can take several hours.

    **What to expect:**
    - Large repositories (100k+ lines): Several hours for initial index
    - Subsequent updates: Much faster, only processes new changes
    - You'll see "updating" tag in dashboard while indexing is in progress

    **If it's stuck:** Contact support with your repository details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Greptile stopped working after recent changes">
    **Check these common causes:**
    - Repository permissions or access tokens may have expired
    - Trigger rules may have been updated to exclude your PRs
    - Repository may have been disconnected accidentally

    **Solutions:**
    - Check repository connection status in dashboard
    - Verify trigger rules still match your workflow
    - Try manual trigger to test if Greptile responds (see [manual triggers](/code-review-bot/trigger-code-review))
  </Accordion>
