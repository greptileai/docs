# Local Code Review with Greptile

Greptile normally leaves review comments directly on GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) or GitLab Merge Requests (MRs).  
But sometimes you want the **experience of a local code review inside your editor**, before sharing code with teammates.  
This guide walks through all the ways you can do that.

---

## How It Works

Greptile reviews are tied to PRs/MRs.  
To simulate a "local" review, you create a **draft (ephemeral) PR/MR** and view Greptile's comments inline in your editor.  
This keeps the loop private and fast, while still using GitHub/GitLab as the review surface.

---

## Prerequisites

- Greptile app installed on your repo (GitHub or GitLab).  
- GitHub or GitLab CLI installed:
  - [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)  
  - [GitLab CLI (`glab`)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)  
- A personal access token (PAT) if required by CLI or MCP setup.  
- Your preferred editor: VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Code.

---

## GitHub

### Using GitHub CLI + VS Code
1. Create a draft PR from your branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --draft --title "Greptile local review" --body "Ephemeral PR for local review"
   ```

2. Open the PR in VS Code with the
   [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request).
   Greptile's inline comments will appear directly in the diff view.
3. When done, close/delete the PR and branch.

---

## GitLab

### Using GitLab CLI or `git push`

1. Create a draft MR:

   ```bash
   glab mr create --draft --fill
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   git push -o merge_request.create -o merge_request.draft
   ```
2. Open the MR in VS Code with the
   [GitLab Workflow extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow).
   Greptile's comments will show inline on the MR diff.
3. Close & clean up the MR after review.

---

## Using MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP lets editors and AI assistants create draft PRs/MRs and fetch Greptile's comments, keeping everything inside your editor or AI chat.

### Setup

* Install an MCP client (VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Code support MCP).
* Add a GitHub or GitLab MCP server (community and official implementations exist).
* Configure your `.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./servers/github-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Workflow

1. Generate a draft PR/MR via MCP.
2. Wait for Greptile to leave review comments.
3. Fetch comments back into your editor (chat buffer, inline view, or file like `greptile_review.md`).

This allows for a truly "local" review loop, without leaving your editor.

## Editor-specific Notes

### VS Code

* **Best supported**: GitHub PRs and GitLab MRs render natively in editor.
* Also works as an MCP client.

### Cursor

* Based on VS Code, so some extensions (like GitHub PRs) may work.
* If the extension misbehaves, use MCP instead (more reliable).

### Claude Code

* No native PR/MR extensions, but supports MCP.
* Use MCP to spin up draft PRs/MRs and fetch Greptile's comments directly into Claude Code chat.

---

## Recipes

### GitHub one-liner

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "Greptile local review" --body "Ephemeral PR"
code .
# In VS Code: open PR with GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension
```

### GitLab one-liner

```bash
git push -o merge_request.create -o merge_request.draft
code .
# In VS Code: open MR with GitLab Workflow extension
```

---

## Security & Cleanup

* **Visibility:** Draft PRs/MRs are still visible to repo collaborators.

  * Use a private fork/mirror repo if you want full privacy.
* **Best practices:**

  * Always mark reviews as **Draft**.
  * Disable notifications (where possible) to avoid pinging teammates.
* **Cleanup:** Delete branches and close PRs/MRs after review.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Comments not showing up?**

  * Check that Greptile is installed on the repo.
  * Verify commits are pushed to the branch.
  * Confirm you're opening the correct PR/MR in your editor.

* **VS Code extension not working in Cursor?**

  * Cursor doesn't always support VS Code extensions fully.
  * Use MCP or open the PR/MR in browser as a fallback.

* **Comments delayed?**

  * Greptile's review may take a minute to complete. Refresh the PR/MR view.

---

## Advanced Automations

You can wrap the flow into a script or git alias for one-step local reviews:

### Example Bash Alias

```bash
git config alias.review-local '!f() {
  branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD);
  gh pr create --draft --title "Local Greptile Review: $branch" --body "Ephemeral PR";
  code .;
}; f'
```

Now you can run:

```bash
git review-local
```

This creates a draft PR, waits for Greptile's comments, and opens VS Code automatically.

## Comparison Table

| Editor          | Extension Support               | MCP Support | Notes                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **VS Code**     | ✅ GitHub PRs / GitLab Workflow  | ✅           | Best supported, seamless UX    |
| **Cursor**      | ⚠️ Some VS Code extensions work | ✅           | MCP is most reliable           |
| **Claude Code** | ❌ No native PR/MR extension     | ✅           | Use MCP to fetch review inline |

## Summary

To get a **local review experience** with Greptile:

* Create a **draft PR/MR** (ephemeral)
* Open it in your editor with the appropriate extension **or via MCP**
* Review Greptile's comments inline, then delete the branch when done

This gives you a private, repeatable workflow that feels local but leverages Greptile's standard review pipeline.
