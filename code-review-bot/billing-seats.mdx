## How Active Seats Are Counted

Greptile counts **active seats** based on users who have:
- **PRO_CHAT entitlement** with no expiration date (`expiresAt: null`)
- Active usage within the billing period

### Automatic Seat Adjustment
Greptile automatically optimizes your billing:
- **Auto-reduction** - When active user count falls below allocated seats, the system automatically reduces your seat count
- **Usage-based scaling** - Seats are adjusted based on actual usage patterns
- **Billing efficiency** - You're only charged for seats that are actively being used

## Managing User Access

### Assigning Seats
Seats are automatically assigned to users when they:
1. Join your organization
2. Get granted `PRO_CHAT` or `CODE_REVIEWS` entitlements
3. Actively use Greptile features

### Excluding Developers
To exclude developers from automatic reviews and seat usage:
- Remove their entitlements through the dashboard
- Use author filtering in `greptile.json` to exclude specific users
- Configure repository-level access controls

### Reducing Seats
To reduce active seats:
1. Remove unused users from your organization
2. Revoke entitlements for inactive users
3. Use the dashboard to adjust subscription limits

## Billing Management

### Subscription Changes
- **Upgrading** - Additional seats are prorated and available immediately
- **Downgrading** - Changes take effect at the next billing cycle
- **Cancellation** - Contact support to cancel your subscription

### Usage Monitoring
Track seat usage through:
- Organization dashboard showing active vs. allocated seats
- Usage reports (contact support for detailed reports)
- Real-time seat allocation in your account settings
