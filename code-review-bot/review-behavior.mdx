## Review Scope & Capabilities

### What Greptile Reviews
- **Pull Requests / Merge Requests** - Complete PR analysis with full context
- **Commit-by-commit analysis** - When multiple commits are in a PR
- **Cross-file impact** - How changes affect related files and dependencies
- **Business logic alignment** - Code changes against requirements and patterns

### What Greptile Does NOT Review
- **Individual commits** - Only reviews complete PRs/MRs, not standalone commits
- **Draft PRs by default** - Must be manually triggered or marked ready for review
- **Merged PRs** - Reviews only happen on open PRs unless manually triggered

## Review Process

### Single-Pass Review System
Greptile uses a **single-pass review approach**:
- Each review is **independent and complete**
- **Not iterative** - doesn't build on previous review comments
- **Fresh analysis** each time, considering all current code

### Review Timing
- **Initial review** - Triggered when PR is first opened
- **Update reviews** - Only if `triggerOnUpdates: true` is configured
- **Manual reviews** - Available anytime via `@greptileai` comment

### Review Content
Each review includes:
1. **PR Summary** - High-level description of changes
2. **Line-by-line comments** - Specific issues and suggestions
3. **Confidence score** - 0-5 rating of how safe the PR is to merge
4. **Cross-file analysis** - Impact on related code

## Current Limitations

### Cannot Cancel Running Reviews
- **No cancellation mechanism** - Reviews run to completion once started
- **Wait before major changes** - Avoid pushing large changes while review is in progress
- **Resource consideration** - Running reviews consume processing time and resources

#### Best Practices
- **Timing pushes** - Wait for review completion before major updates
- **Incremental changes** - Make smaller, focused commits to reduce review conflicts
- **Communication** - Let team know when pushing changes to active PRs

### Review Frequency Limitations
- **No multi-pass reviews** - Each review is a complete, independent analysis
- **No iterative improvement** - Cannot ask Greptile to "try again" or "review differently"
- **Fresh perspective each time** - May repeat similar comments across reviews

### Auto-Approval Limitations
- **No automatic approval** - Greptile cannot automatically approve PRs
- **Humans required** - All PR approvals must come from human reviewers
- **Status checks only** - Can block merging but cannot approve merging

## Understanding Review Updates

### When `triggerOnUpdates` is Enabled
```json greptile.json
{
  "triggerOnUpdates": true
}
```

**Every new commit** triggers a fresh review:
- **Complete re-analysis** - Doesn't build on previous reviews
- **All files re-examined** - Even unchanged files are reconsidered for context
- **Fresh comments** - Previous review comments don't influence new ones

### When `triggerOnUpdates` is Disabled (Default)
- **Single initial review** - Only when PR is first opened
- **Manual re-review only** - Use `@greptileai` comment to trigger new review
- **Reduced noise** - Avoids constant re-reviews during development

## Review Consistency

### What Stays Consistent
- **Code analysis quality** - Same depth of analysis each time
- **Context awareness** - Always considers full codebase context
- **Rule application** - Custom rules applied consistently

### What May Vary
- **Comment phrasing** - AI may express similar issues differently
- **Priority focus** - May highlight different aspects of the same issue
- **Example suggestions** - Different but equivalent solutions may be suggested

## Integration with Workflows

### Status Checks Integration
- **Blocks merging** until review completes
- **Provides review status** to GitHub/GitLab
- **Integrates with branch protection** rules

### Team Workflows
- **Complements human review** - Not a replacement for human reviewers
- **Pre-review filtering** - Catches issues before human review
- **Focus enhancement** - Allows human reviewers to focus on architecture and business logic

## Performance Considerations

### Review Speed Factors
- **Repository size** - Larger codebases take longer to analyze
- **Change complexity** - More complex changes require deeper analysis
- **External context** - Jira/Notion integration may add processing time
- **First-time indexing** - New repositories require initial setup time

### Optimization Tips
- **Smaller PRs** - Break large changes into focused, smaller PRs
- **Clear descriptions** - Help Greptile understand the intent quickly
- **Consistent patterns** - Following established patterns speeds analysis
