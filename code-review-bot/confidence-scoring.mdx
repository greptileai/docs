## Understanding Confidence Scores

Greptile assigns each pull request a **Confidence Score** from 0-5 to indicate how safe the PR is to merge:

### Score Meanings
- **0/5** - Definitely not ready, will cause problems
- **1/5** - Very likely to cause issues, needs significant changes
- **2/5** - Likely to cause some problems, requires attention
- **3/5** - Some concerns, but generally safe with minor fixes
- **4/5** - Very safe to merge, minimal risk
- **5/5** - Extremely unlikely to cause production issues

### How Scores Are Calculated
The confidence score is generated by analyzing:
- **Code quality issues** - Bugs, logic errors, potential crashes
- **Security vulnerabilities** - Authentication, authorization, data exposure risks
- **Performance implications** - Inefficient algorithms, resource usage
- **Breaking changes** - API changes, dependency impacts
- **Test coverage** - Whether changes are adequately tested
- **Compliance with patterns** - Adherence to your team's coding standards

## Using Confidence Scores

### Review Prioritization
- **Low scores (0-2)** - Require immediate attention and thorough review
- **Medium scores (3)** - Standard review process with focus on flagged issues
- **High scores (4-5)** - Can be fast-tracked with lighter review

### Automated Workflows
You can configure automated actions based on confidence scores:
- Block merging of PRs below a certain threshold
- Request additional reviewers for low-confidence PRs
- Auto-approve high-confidence PRs (when configured)
