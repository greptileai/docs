<Note>
   These instructions are for Greptile's Self-Hosted SSO service. If you are using Greptile on the web and want to enable SSO, please contact us at [support@greptile.com](mailto:support@greptile.com).
</Note>

Follow these instructions to enable Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML via BoxyHQ for your Greptile application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following services are operational:
- `web` (Greptile web application)
- `jackson` (BoxyHQ SSO service)

## Configure Jackson Service

Set these environment variables for the Jackson service:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encryption key | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `HOST_URL` | Jackson service URL | `sso.greptile.com` |
| `EXTERNAL_URL` | External Jackson URL | `https://sso.greptile.com` |
| `JACKSON_API_KEYS` | API Keys for Jackson | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `SAML_AUDIENCE` | Audience identifier | `https://sso.greptile.com` |
| `CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER` | Secret verifier (alphanumeric only) | `dummy` |
| `NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` | Admin credentials | `admin@greptile.com:mysupersecretpassword` |
| `PUBLIC_KEY` | Certificate (see [Jackson docs](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/env-variables)) | Starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key (see [Jackson docs](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/env-variables)) | PEM formatted |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Same as `EXTERNAL_URL` | `https://sso.greptile.com` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | JWT secret from `web` service | JWT secret |
| `IDP_ENABLED` | Enable IdP | `true` |

## Set Up Database Entries

1. Log in to your PostgreSQL database.
2. Create or locate an existing `Organization`.
3. Generate an `InternalApiKey`:

   ```shell
   openssl rand -base64 36
   ```

4. Insert a new `SamlConnection`:

   - Set `org_id` to your Organization ID.
   - Set `tenant_id` to your user's email domain (e.g., `example.com`).

## Configure SSO Connection

1. Visit the Jackson admin console (`https://sso.greptile.com`).
2. Log in using admin credentials configured earlier.
3. Navigate to **Enterprise SSO â†’ Connections**.
4. Click **New Setup Link**.
   - Set tenant to user's email domain.
   - Set product as `greptile`.
   - Allowed redirect URL: `https://app.greptile.com`
   - Default redirect URL: `https://app.greptile.com/login/saml`
5. Generate the setup link.
6. Share the setup link with your customer for SSO provider configuration.

## Completing SSO Setup

Once your customer has completed the configuration:
- Users can log in via their SSO provider at your web application.
- New SSO users will automatically be added to your Organization.

## Testing

For local testing, use [MockSAML](https://mocksaml.com/) with tenant set to `example.com`.

## Important Notes
- `AUTH_BOXYHQ_SAML_SECRET` in your web service must match Jackson's `CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER` and should **not** include special characters.
