## AI Models Used by Greptile

Greptile uses state-of-the-art AI models with a fallback strategy for reliability:

### Primary Models
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) - Primary model from Anthropic
- **GPT-4o** - Secondary model from OpenAI
- **AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Cloud-hosted fallback option

### Fallback Strategy
Greptile automatically falls back between providers (Anthropic → OpenAI → AWS Bedrock) to ensure high availability and reliability of code reviews.

## Hosting Options

### Cloud Hosting
Greptile's default cloud hosting uses the models above with automatic failover between providers.

### Self-Hosting
For enterprise customers, Greptile supports self-hosting with:
- **AWS Bedrock integration** - Use your own AWS account with Bedrock models
- **Custom base URLs** - Point to your own hosted model endpoints
- **Air-gapped deployments** - Complete isolation in your infrastructure

Learn more about self-hosting options in our [self-hosting documentation](/self-hosting/overview).

### Unsupported Providers
- **GCP Vertex AI** - Not currently supported
- Custom model training - Greptile does not fine-tune models on customer code
