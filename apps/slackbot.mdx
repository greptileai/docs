### Installation

Click [here](https://app.greptile.com/login) to install the Slackbot. Once you have installed the bot, you can use the same link to configure the bot. 

Configuration includes:
1. Setting up triggers, for example `@mentions`, or all messages in a specific `#channel`.
2. Setting reference repositories, so the bot can provide context-aware answers.
3. *Optional*: Providing "special instructions" for the bot to follow, for example, "Answer in 1-2 sentences only".

<Note>
For Greptile to reference repos, they must first be **indexed**, which can be done by submitting them through the frontend [here](https://app.greptile.com/login).
