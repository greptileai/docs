## API Response Fields

When using Greptile's API, you'll encounter several key response fields:

### Core Response Fields
- **`sessionId`** - Tracks conversation sessions in LLM calls. Use this to maintain context across multiple API requests in the same session.
- **`statusEndpoint`** - Provides a URL for checking the progress of indexing or review operations. Poll this endpoint to get real-time updates on long-running processes.
- **`sources`** - Contains references to the code files and locations that informed the response.
- **`messages.id`** - Unique identifier for each message in the conversation thread.

### Using statusEndpoint
The `statusEndpoint` is particularly useful for:
- **Repository indexing** - Check when a repository has finished being indexed
- **Review progress** - Monitor the status of ongoing PR reviews
- **Long-running queries** - Track progress of complex codebase analysis

Example of polling a status endpoint:
```javascript
// Initial API call returns statusEndpoint
const response = await greptileAPI.query({...});
const statusUrl = response.statusEndpoint;

// Poll for completion
const checkStatus = async () => {
  const status = await fetch(statusUrl);
  const data = await status.json();

  if (data.status === 'completed') {
    // Process completed results
    return data;
  } else if (data.status === 'failed') {
    // Handle error
    throw new Error(data.error);
  } else {
    // Still processing, check again later
    setTimeout(checkStatus, 1000);
  }
};
```

## Webhook Configuration

### GitHub Webhooks
- **Endpoint** - `/webhook` (configured automatically with GitHub App)
- **Authentication** - Uses `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for verification
- **Events** - Handles PR creation, updates, and synchronization events

### GitLab Webhooks
- **Authentication** - Uses `X-GitLab-Token` header for verification
- **Events** - Handles merge request events and push updates
- **Self-hosted** - Supports self-hosted GitLab instances with domain-specific configuration

### Webhook Security
- All webhooks are verified using cryptographic signatures
- Tokens are validated before processing any webhook events
- Failed authentication attempts are logged and rejected

## Error Handling

### "Code review failed" Errors
Common causes and solutions:
- **Repository not indexed** - Ensure the repository has been added to Greptile and indexing is complete
- **Authentication issues** - Verify that tokens have the correct permissions
- **Rate limiting** - Requests may be throttled during high usage periods
- **Large diffs** - Very large PRs may timeout and require manual retry
