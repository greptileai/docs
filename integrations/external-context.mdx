## Overview

Greptile can integrate with external sources to provide richer context during code reviews. This helps ensure that code changes align with business requirements, specifications, and project goals.

## Supported Integrations

### Jira Integration

Greptile can **read and analyze Jira tickets** referenced in your PRs to provide context-aware reviews.

#### How It Works
- **Automatic ticket detection** - Greptile identifies Jira ticket references in PR titles, descriptions, and commit messages
- **Requirement verification** - Reviews code against ticket requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Context-aware comments** - Comments consider the business context from linked tickets
- **Status awareness** - Understands ticket priority and type (bug, feature, story)

#### Setup
1. Connect your Jira instance through the Greptile dashboard
2. Configure authentication and permissions
3. Greptile will automatically detect and use ticket context in reviews

#### Example Usage
```
PR Title: "JIRA-123: Add user authentication endpoint"
Ticket Content: "As a user, I want to login securely..."

Greptile Review: "The implementation looks good, but the ticket
requires password complexity validation which seems missing from
this endpoint implementation."
```

### Notion Integration

Greptile can access **Notion documents** for specifications, architecture docs, and business context.

#### Capabilities
- **Spec document analysis** - Reads product requirements and technical specifications
- **Architecture alignment** - Verifies code follows documented architecture patterns
- **Business context** - Understands product goals and constraints from planning docs
- **Design system compliance** - Checks against design system documentation

#### Setup
1. Grant Greptile access to relevant Notion workspaces
2. Specify which documents/databases to use for context
3. Configure access permissions for your team's documentation

### Google Drive Integration

Access **Google Drive documents** for additional context and specifications.

#### Use Cases
- **PRDs and specifications** stored in Google Docs
- **Architecture diagrams** and technical documentation
- **Meeting notes** and decision records
- **Shared spreadsheets** with requirements or configurations

#### Setup
1. Connect your Google Drive account through the dashboard
2. Grant permissions to specific folders or documents
3. Greptile will index and reference relevant content during reviews

### Linear Integration

<Note>
Linear integration is **temporarily unavailable** but will return with enhanced features. Contact hello@greptile.com for updates.
</Note>

When available, Linear integration will provide:
- Issue tracking and context
- Sprint planning alignment
- Project milestone awareness
- Team priority understanding

## Pattern Repositories

Connect **supporting repositories** and **custom documentation** using `patternRepositories` in your greptile.json:

```json greptile.json
{
  "patternRepositories": [
    "acme/frontend-patterns",
    "acme/api-documentation",
    "acme/design-system"
  ]
}
```

### Use Cases
- **Shared libraries** - Reference common utilities and patterns
- **API documentation** - Understand API contracts when reviewing backend changes
- **Design systems** - Ensure frontend changes follow established patterns
- **Testing frameworks** - Reference testing patterns and utilities

### Benefits
- **Cross-repository awareness** - Reviews consider related codebases
- **Pattern consistency** - Ensures new code follows established patterns
- **Reduced duplication** - Identifies existing solutions before creating new ones

## Custom Documentation Sources

### Pipeline Integration
You can connect custom documentation sources without adding them directly to your repository:

- **CI/CD pipeline integration** - Automatically sync documentation during builds
- **External documentation sites** - Reference wiki pages and knowledge bases
- **API documentation** - Connect OpenAPI specs and GraphQL schemas

### Setup Process
1. Configure webhook or API access to your documentation source
2. Set up automated syncing through build pipelines
3. Reference documentation in greptile.json configuration

## Coming Soon

### Planned Integrations
- **Slack** - Enhanced notifications and team communication
- **Confluence** - Enterprise documentation access
- **Azure DevOps** - Work item tracking and documentation
- **GitHub Issues** - Enhanced issue context and tracking

### Beta Program
Want early access to new integrations? Contact hello@greptile.com to join our beta program and influence which integrations we prioritize.

## Configuration Examples

### Multi-Source Context
```json greptile.json
{
  "patternRepositories": [
    "acme/shared-utils",
    "acme/api-docs"
  ],
  "instructions": "Reference Jira tickets for business context and check API docs for breaking changes",
  "externalSources": {
    "jira": {
      "projectKeys": ["PROJ", "FEAT"]
    },
    "notion": {
      "databases": ["architecture", "specifications"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Context Prioritization
```json
{
  "contextPriority": [
    "jira-tickets",
    "pattern-repositories",
    "notion-specs",
    "google-drive-docs"
  ]
}
```
