description: "Greptile adds comments with helpful codebase context to your GitHub Issues"

Greptile can be configured to trigger a comment:

1. For all issues
2. Issues in certain workspaces, projects, teams, or labels
3. Issues that mention `@greptile` in the body

### Installation

Click [here](https://app.greptile.com/apps/) to install the GitHub Issue bot. Once you have installed the bot, you can use the same link to configure the bot. You can find a more detailed guide on how to install the bot in the [Code Review Bot documentation](/apps/cr).

Configuration includes:

1. Setting up triggers, for example `@mentions`, or certain filters like workspace, project, team, or label.
2. Setting target repositories, so the bot can comment on issues for those repos.
3. _Optional_: Providing "special instructions" for the bot to follow, for example, "Include a section on compliance implications".

<Note>
  For Greptile to reference repos, they must first be **indexed**, which can be
  done by submitting them through the frontend
  [here](https://app.greptile.com/chat).
</Note>

### Why is it useful?

Greptile's GitHub Issue bot writes comments that:

1. Cover how to do the issue, so engineers can quickly get context and start the issue.
2. Link to relevant files in the codebase, so engineers know where to start looking.
3. Cover potential implications top security, stability, or potential bugs this issue could introduce elsewhere in the codebase.
4. Reference similar code or abstractions related to the issue that are already in the codebase, to prevent repetition.
