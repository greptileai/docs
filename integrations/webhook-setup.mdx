## GitHub Webhook Setup

GitHub webhooks are **automatically configured** when you install the Greptile GitHub App. No manual setup is required.

### Automatic Configuration
1. Install the Greptile GitHub App from the marketplace
2. Grant repository permissions during installation
3. Webhooks are automatically created for:
   - Pull request events (opened, updated, closed)
   - Push events to PR branches
   - Review request events

### Verification
To verify webhooks are working:
1. Go to your repository settings → Webhooks
2. Look for a webhook pointing to Greptile's endpoint
3. Check recent deliveries for successful responses (200 status)

### Troubleshooting
- **Webhook not appearing**: Reinstall the GitHub App with proper permissions
- **Failed deliveries**: Check that repository access hasn't been revoked
- **Missing reviews**: Ensure the repository is enabled in your Greptile dashboard

## GitLab Webhook Setup

GitLab webhooks require manual configuration through app.greptile.com.

### Setup Process
1. Go to [app.greptile.com](https://app.greptile.com)
2. Navigate to your GitLab integration settings
3. Follow the **on-screen instructions** to configure webhooks
4. Copy the provided webhook URL and secret

### GitLab Configuration
1. In your GitLab project, go to Settings → Webhooks
2. Add a new webhook with:
   - **URL**: The webhook URL from Greptile dashboard
   - **Secret Token**: The secret provided by Greptile
   - **Trigger events**:
     - Merge requests events
     - Push events
     - Wiki page events (optional)

### Self-Hosted GitLab
For self-hosted GitLab instances:
1. Ensure your GitLab instance can reach Greptile's webhook endpoint
2. Use the domain-specific token format: `X-Token-{sanitized-hostname}`
3. Configure firewall rules to allow outbound webhook calls
4. Test connectivity before configuring webhooks

### Webhook Events
Greptile listens for these GitLab events:
- **Merge request opened** - Triggers initial review
- **Merge request updated** - Triggers re-review (if enabled)
- **Push to MR branch** - Updates review with new commits

### Security
- All webhook payloads are verified using the secret token
- Failed authentication attempts are logged and rejected
- Webhooks use HTTPS for secure transmission

### Troubleshooting GitLab Webhooks
- **Webhook fails**: Verify the URL and secret token are correct
- **No reviews triggered**: Check that merge request events are enabled
- **Connection timeout**: Ensure GitLab can reach Greptile's servers
- **SSL errors**: Verify GitLab's SSL certificate configuration
