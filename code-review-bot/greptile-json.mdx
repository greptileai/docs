metaDescription: "Learn how to customize Greptile settings and patterns for individual repositories using greptile.json configuration."
---

You can have custom settings at the repo level by adding a `greptile.json` file to the root of the repo. Settings will be read from the source branch of the PR.

You can grab your global settings in the correct format [here](https://app.greptile.com/review/github?tab=config) by clicking on the `copy` or `download` icons on the top right of the Settings panel.

### Configuration Hierarchy

Settings in `greptile.json` **override** dashboard settings for that repository. The hierarchy is:
1. **greptile.json** (highest priority) - Repository-specific configuration
2. **Dashboard settings** (lower priority) - Organization-wide defaults

This allows you to set organization-wide defaults in the dashboard while customizing specific repositories with greptile.json.

<Note>
  The `ignorePatterns` field follows `.gitignore`
  [syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `labels`                  | array   | Labels that will trigger a Greptile review when added to a PR. In the example above, adding "feature" or "bug" label will trigger a review.  |
| `comment`                 | string  | A disclaimer or prefix that will be added to every Greptile PR summary. Useful for compliance requirements.                                  |
| `commentTypes`            | array   | Types of comments Greptile should make. Options: "logic" (business logic issues), "syntax" (language-specific best practices), "style" (formatting, naming conventions). All enabled by default. |
| `instructions`            | string  | Natural language custom instructions for Greptile to follow when reviewing code. Can reference files in your repo or contain specific rules. |
| `ignoreKeywords`          | string  | Newline-separated list of keywords. PRs with these keywords in their title or description will be ignored.                                   |
| `ignorePatterns`          | string  | Newline-separated list of file patterns to ignore, following .gitignore syntax. Files matching these patterns will not be reviewed.          |
| `patternRepositories`     | array   | List of repositories to learn patterns from. Greptile will analyze these repos to understand your codebase's patterns.                       |
| `triggerOnUpdates`        | boolean | If true, Greptile will review code every time a PR is updated with a new commit.                                                             |
| `shouldUpdateDescription` | boolean | If true, Greptile will update the PR description with a summary of changes. If false, only comments on code.                                 |
| `disabledLabels`          | array   | PRs with these labels will not be reviewed by Greptile, even if other trigger conditions are met.                                            |
| `includeAuthors`          | array   | Only PRs from these authors will be reviewed. If empty, reviews PRs from all authors (except excluded ones).                                 |
| `excludeAuthors`          | array   | PRs from these authors will not be reviewed, even if other trigger conditions are met.                                                       |
| `strictness`              | number  | Severity threshold for Greptile comments (1-3). 1 = comment on all issues, 2 = moderate filtering, 3 = only most critical issues.            |
| `directoryRules`          | object  | Apply specific rules to certain directories using glob patterns. See directory-specific rules section below.                                     |

## Comment Types Explained

### Available Comment Types
- **`logic`** - Business logic issues, algorithmic problems, potential bugs
- **`syntax`** - Language-specific best practices, proper usage patterns
- **`style`** - Code formatting, naming conventions, structural consistency

All comment types are **enabled by default**. You can restrict reviews to specific types by setting `commentTypes` to a subset.

### Example Configurations
```json
// Only check for logic issues (most critical)
{
  "commentTypes": ["logic"]
}

// Focus on code quality without style nitpicks
{
  "commentTypes": ["logic", "syntax"]
}
```

## Directory-Specific Rules

You can apply different rules to specific directories using glob patterns:

```json
{
  "directoryRules": {
    "src/critical/**": {
      "strictness": 1,
      "commentTypes": ["logic", "syntax"]
    },
    "tests/**": {
      "strictness": 3,
      "commentTypes": ["logic"]
    },
    "docs/**": {
      "strictness": 2,
      "commentTypes": ["style"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Cases
- **Critical paths** - Maximum scrutiny on core business logic
- **Test files** - Focus only on serious issues
- **Documentation** - Primarily style and formatting checks
- **Legacy code** - Reduced noise during refactoring
