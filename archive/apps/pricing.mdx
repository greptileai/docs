## Greptile Chat

Greptile chat is the web-based chat interface that allows you to interact with Greptile. There are three plans available:

| Property | Free | Pro |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Price     | $0 ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ |      $20/mo/seat |
| Repo size limit      | 10MB       |   ∞     |
| Private repos     | -      |   ✓    |
| Add your team    | -      |   ✓    |
| Share sessions     | -      |   ✓ |
| Multiple repos in chat     | -      |   ✓    |
| Email Support     | -      |   48 hr    |
| Shared Slack channel     | -      |   -    |
| SOC2 compliance     | -      |   -    |


<Note>While the Pro and Business tiers are both SOC2 compliant, we only share reports, undergo security review, and share other security details to Business tier customers. </Note>

## Greptile API

Greptile API is priced per "unit", which costs $0.15. The only endpoints with a cost is `POST /query`. 

A call to `POST /query` is 1 unit.

A call to `POST /query` with parameter `genius=true`, which uses a larger, more powerful model suitable for complex tasks such as diagnosing bugs, is 3 units.

## Greptile Code Review Bot

The Greptile Code Review Bot is priced \$0.45 per file changed up to $50/developer/month, past which usage is free. 

### Example

If your team comprises 4 developers that open many PRs per week, and perhaps an engineering manager that opens one PR with 5 files changed that month, the bill for the month will be no more than:

$$50 * 4 + 0.45 * 5 = 202.25$$
