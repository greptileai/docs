Use Greptile's MCP server to automatically retrieve and resolve code review comments directly in your IDE.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: First [set up the MCP server in your IDE](/mcp/setup-ides), then follow the workflows below.
</Note>

## Overview

Once you have set up the Greptile MCP server in your IDE, you will be able to:
- Retrieve unaddressed review comments
- Search for specific types of issues
- Get context about why issues were flagged
- Apply fixes based on Greptile's suggestions

...all from within your IDE.

## Retrieving Comments

### Get Comments for Current PR

<Steps>
    <Step title="Identify Current PR">
        When working on a branch, your IDE will automatically detect the associated PR.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Ask for Comments">
        Use these proven prompts with Claude:
        - "Show me all unaddressed Greptile comments for this PR"
        - "What security issues has Greptile found recently?"
        - "Search for Greptile comments about error handling"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Review Comment Details">
        Claude will show you:
        - Complete comment text with context
        - File paths and specific line numbers
        - Whether comments are addressed or still open
        - Related custom context patterns that were violated
        - PR information and repository details
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Search for Specific Issues

**Find Comments by Type:**
- *"Find all security-related Greptile comments in this repository"*
- *"Show me performance issues flagged by Greptile"*
- *"Get error handling comments from recent reviews"*

**Find Comments by File:**
- *"Show Greptile comments for the current file"*
- *"Are there any unaddressed reviews for src/auth.js?"*
- *"What issues has Greptile found in this component?"*

These searches work across your entire organization's repositories and return real comment data with file locations and context.

## Resolving Comments Step-by-Step

### Automated Resolution

<Steps>
    <Step title="Select Comment to Fix">
        In your IDE, click on a Greptile comment or use:
        "Fix this Greptile comment: [paste comment text]"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Analyze the Issue">
        The IDE will:
        - Read the comment and understand the problem
        - Examine the code context
        - Check related custom context patterns
        - Determine the appropriate fix strategy
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate Fix">
        The coding agent will:
        - Propose a specific code change
        - Explain why this fix addresses the issue
        - Show before/after code comparison
    </Step>
    <Step title="Apply Fix">
        Review and apply the suggested changes:
        - "Apply this fix"
        - "Show me the diff first"
        - "Explain why this fixes the issue"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Resolution">
        Confirm the fix addresses the original concern:
        - Run relevant tests
        - Check for syntax errors
        - Validate the solution makes sense
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Resolution with AI Guidance

**Get Detailed Explanation:**
- *"Explain this Greptile comment in detail and suggest how to fix it"*
- *"Why is this flagged as a security issue?"*
- *"What's the best way to resolve this performance concern?"*

**Get Fix Suggestions:**
- *"How should I fix this memory leak issue?"*
- *"Suggest 2-3 ways to address this code duplication"*
- *"What's the proper error handling pattern here?"*

## Practical Examples

### Security Issue Resolution

**Greptile Comment:**
> "Consider adding input validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. The user input should be sanitized before processing."

**In Claude Code:**
```
You: "Fix this security issue: Missing input validation for user ID parameter"

Claude Code: I'll help you add proper input validation. Looking at your code, I can see the getUserData function is missing validation. Here's the fix:

[Shows before/after code with input validation added]

Would you like me to apply this fix and also check for similar issues in other functions?
```

### Performance Issue Resolution

**Greptile Comment:**
> "N+1 query problem detected - consider using joins or batch loading"

**In Cursor:**
```
You: "How do I fix this N+1 query problem?"

Cursor: I can see the issue in your code. You're making individual database queries in a loop. Here's how to fix it with a join:

[Shows optimized query with proper joins]

This will reduce your database calls from N+1 to just 1. Should I apply this change?
```

### Code Style Violation

**Greptile Comment:**
> "Use camelCase for variable names according to team guidelines"

**Resolution Workflow:**
```
You: "Fix the naming convention issues in this file"

IDE: I found 3 variables that need to be converted to camelCase:
- user_data → userData
- is_valid → isValid
- api_response → apiResponse

I'll update these and any references. Applying changes now...
```

## Advanced Workflows

<Note>
The following sections cover advanced automation. For basic comment resolution, the steps above are sufficient.
</Note>

### Batch Comment Resolution

**Resolve Multiple Comments:**
```
You: "Show me all unaddressed Greptile comments for this PR and fix the ones you can automatically"

IDE: I found 8 unaddressed comments:
✅ Fixed: 3 naming convention issues
✅ Fixed: 2 missing error handling cases
⚠️  Needs review: 1 architecture concern
⚠️  Needs review: 2 complex logic issues

I've applied the automatic fixes. The remaining 3 comments need your input because they involve design decisions.
```

### Context-Aware Fixes

**Using Custom Context:**
```
You: "Fix this error handling according to our team patterns"

IDE: Based on your organization's custom context, I see you use Result<T, E> for error handling. I'll update this function to follow that pattern:

[Shows conversion from try/catch to Result pattern]

This matches the pattern used in 15 other functions in your codebase.
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

**Pre-commit Resolution:**
```
You: "Before I commit, check if there are any unaddressed Greptile comments in my changes"

IDE: I found 2 unaddressed comments in your staged files:
1. Missing null check in user.service.js:45
2. Inconsistent error message format in auth.controller.js:23

Would you like me to fix these before you commit?
```

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Quick Reference: When to Use Auto-Fix vs Manual Review">

### When to Use Auto-Fix

**Safe for Auto-Fix:**
- Code style and formatting issues
- Simple null checks and validation
- Naming convention corrections
- Basic error handling additions

**Requires Review:**
- Architecture and design changes
- Complex logic modifications
- Performance optimizations with tradeoffs
- Security fixes affecting business logic

### Verification Steps

- **Code Review**: Always review auto-generated fixes before applying them to ensure they make sense in context
- **Test execution:** Run relevant tests after applying fixes to catch any regressions
- **Review integration:** Mark comments as addressed only after verification
- **Rollback capability:** Provide undo functionality for problematic fixes

### Human Oversight

- **Confidence scoring:** Only auto-apply high-confidence fixes
- **Review queuing:** Queue uncertain fixes for human review
- **Explanation logging:** Document what changes were made and why
- **Approval workflows:** Require human approval for critical file changes
