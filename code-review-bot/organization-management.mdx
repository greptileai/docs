## User Roles & Permissions

Greptile supports three role types within organizations:

### Role Types
- **OWNER** - Full administrative access to the organization
- **ADMIN** - Administrative access with some restrictions
- **MEMBER** - Standard user access

### Entitlements
Users can have the following entitlements based on their subscription:
- **API_ACCESS** - Access to Greptile's API endpoints
- **PRO_CHAT** - Access to advanced chat features and codebase querying
- **CODE_REVIEWS** - Access to automated code review features

## Team Management

### Creating Teams
Teams in Greptile are represented as organizations with multiple users assigned different roles.

### Managing Members
- Add users to your organization through the dashboard
- Assign appropriate roles based on their responsibilities
- Users can belong to multiple organizations

### Data Isolation
Each organization (team) operates independently:
- **Separate codebases** - Each organization's repositories are isolated
- **Independent settings** - Configuration doesn't leak between organizations
- **Isolated learning** - Feedback and learning are scoped to each organization

## Multi-Organization Support

### Connecting Multiple GitHub Organizations
You can connect multiple GitHub organizations to a single Greptile account, allowing you to manage code reviews across all your repositories from one place.

### Access Control
- Repository access is controlled by the underlying GitHub/GitLab permissions
- Users only see repositories they have access to in the connected code hosts
- Organization-level settings apply only to repositories within that organization
