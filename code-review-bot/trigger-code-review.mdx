By default, Greptile reviews **every new PR** when it is first opened or when a user comments `@greptileai` on the PR. It can also be configured to review PRs on certain triggers.

### Draft PR Behavior

**Draft PRs are not automatically reviewed** by default to avoid noise during development. However, you can:
- **Manually trigger** reviews on draft PRs by commenting `@greptileai`
- **Configure automatic reviews** for drafts (contact support for this option)
- Reviews will automatically start when you **mark the PR as ready for review**


### Filters

You can configure Greptile to only review PRs that match certain filters. The filters can be configured in the [dashboard](https://app.greptile.com/review), or in your [`greptile.json` file](/code-review-bot/greptile-json).

| Filter By | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `labels`  | Include or exclude PRs with specific labels |
| `branches` | Include or exclude PRs to or from specific branches |
| `author` | Include or exclude PRs based on PR author |
| `keywords` | Include or exclude PRs containing a specific keyword in the title, description,or last commit message |


### Manual Triggering

You can trigger Greptile to review a PR manually by commenting `@greptileai` on the PR.

#### When to Use Manual Triggering
- **Draft PRs** that need early feedback
- **Re-review after major changes** (though Greptile will note what changed)
- **PRs that don't match automatic triggers** due to filters
- **Testing Greptile configuration** changes

<Note>
GitHub does not allow users to tag bots, so as you comment `@greptileai` it may not show you the bot in the dropdown suggestions.
</Note>

### Status Checks & Merge Protection

You can configure Greptile to **block merging** until reviews are complete:

#### GitHub Status Checks
1. Go to your repository Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add or edit a branch protection rule
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Search for and select the **Greptile status check**
5. Save the protection rule

#### Benefits
- **Prevents accidental merges** before review completion
- **Ensures code quality** by requiring Greptile approval
- **Integrates with existing workflows** alongside other required checks

<Warning>
Status checks will prevent merging even if Greptile finds no issues. Make sure your team understands this workflow change.
</Warning>

### Auto-Review on Every Commit

By default, Greptile only reviews the initial PR. You can enable **continuous review**:

```json greptile.json
{
  "triggerOnUpdates": true
}
```

When enabled:
- **Every new commit** to the PR branch triggers a fresh review
- **Keeps reviews current** as code evolves
- **May increase review volume** - consider adjusting strictness settings

### Review Limitations

- **Cannot cancel running reviews** - wait for completion before pushing major changes
- **Reviews PRs/MRs only** - individual commits are not reviewed separately
- **Single-pass system** - each review is independent, not iterative
